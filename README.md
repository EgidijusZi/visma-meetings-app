# visma-meetings-app

First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in the Visma Java Developer internship selection.
Several comments from my side about my code:
1. Much more unit tests are required.
2. Didn't implement the filtering by the number of attendees.
3. Not validating type and category of meeting for fixed values.
4. Regarding adding the attendee to the meeting - instead of specifying the time, I decided that the person who adds attendees to the meeting should specify the name of the meeting (of course... names of meetings could be duplicated, and it's not the best approach).
